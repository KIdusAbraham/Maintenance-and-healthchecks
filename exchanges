Hi Doug and Abraham, are we close to having this report back up and running?  
Also, if you havenâ€™t already, please provide the updated manual report to Ellen and Kristen. 
That report is needed on a daily basis.

Hi Brett, 

I am still working on the issue. I hope to resolve it today or tomorrrow. 
I will send the manual report every morning to Ellen and Kristen until the job is working again. 

Thanks, Abraham
